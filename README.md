 <img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/6lcIxDs.png" alt="header" width="500"/>

This is a classic checkers game, running on [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser).

I used [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) with ⚡️ lightning fast HMR through [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Commands

| `npm build` | Builds code bundle with production settings  |
| `npm serve` | Run a web server to serve built code bundle |

## Development

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development
server by running `npm dev` and navigate to <http://localhost:3000>.

## Production

After running `npm build`, the files you need for production will be on the `dist` folder.
To test code on your `dist` folder, run `npm serve` and navigate to <http://localhost:5000>
